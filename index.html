    <h1>CSS Week 8 Assignment</h1>
    <h3>-What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h3>
    <p>Id be the first to admit that CSS and web design are not my forte but i found tremendous help in looking at different webpages and observing the code
        layout through the developer tools.</p>
        <h3>-What would you change about the course?</h3>
        <p>I myself happened to come to this course later and missed its predecessor HTML, i would have enjoyed more small projects to grasp measurements
            and layouts more easily.</p>
            <h3>-Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h3>
            <p>I very much did'nt know what to expect when starting this course and am still surprised by what I have come to learn already.</p>
